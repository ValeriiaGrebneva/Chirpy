While doing this Chirpy project, I learned how to:
* build an HTTP server in Go
* handle communication client-server with RESTful APIs using headers, JSON, and status codes
* use PostgreSQL database, create migrations and queries for keeping and retrieving data (Goose and SQLC are helpful tools)
* create authentication and authorization systems
* implement webhooks
